<h1 align="center"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<h2 align="center">âœ¨ Welcome to my Github!âœ¨</h2>

<p align="center"><strong>I'm Cecilia - Frontend dev & photographer</strong>. I'm originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina, but I've been living in Barcelona since 2016. My journey has been quite the rollercoaster ride, filled with twists and turns. </p>
<p align="center">I've studied photography, but a few years ago, I made a career shift to frontend development. Since then, I've been on a journey of continuous learning and skill-building. I received a scholarship to study frontend development at Ironhack, where I developed my web development skills. <br/> Currently, I'm pursuing a programming scholarship at 42 Barcelona, known for its innovative peer-to-peer teaching method. Additionally, I've been taking one-on-one classes with a private tutor since January, further enhancing my frontend development skills.</p>
